**INTRODUCTION**

The Quiz App is a frond-end web-based application designed to test and enhance users basic knowledge of JavaScript. Built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides an interactive platform where users can engage with timed multiple-choice questions, receive immediate feedback, and track their performance through scores and progress indicators.

**Technologies Used :**

- HTML is used to create the structure of the webpage, including containers, buttons, and question elements.

-CSS handles the visual styling, ensures the layout is clean, centered, and responsive.

-JavaScript provides the core functionality such as displaying questions, handling timers, capturing answers, updating scores, and showing explanations.

-LocalStorage is used to save the highest score and store user feedback locally on the browser.

**Key Features:**
1. *Multiple Choice Questions* : The quiz includes a list of questions with four possible answers each. Users select one option per question, and the application immediately shows whether the choice was correct or not.

2. *Timer for Each Question* : A 10-second countdown timer is displayed for every question. If the user does not select an answer within the given time, the app automatically highlights the correct answer.

3. *Progress Bar* : A visual progress bar fills as the user moves through the quiz, providing an idea of how many questions have been completed.

4. *Score Tracking* : At the end of the quiz, users are shown their total score along with the total time taken. The score is compared against the highest score stored in the browser.

5. *Explanations* : Each question includes a brief explanation that helps users understand the correct answer, reinforcing learning.

6. *Feedback Form* : Users can leave feedback after completing the quiz. Their comments are saved in LocalStorage and acknowledged with a confirmation message.

**Working Process:**
When the quiz starts, questions and answer options are randomized to ensure variety. Users click on answers, and the app provides immediate visual feedback with color-coded buttons. The quiz progresses through the questions automatically, with users navigating using the “Next” button. After all questions are answered or timed out, the final score and high score are shown, followed by an option to submit feedback.

**Conclusion**
This task showcases how basic frond end web development skills can be combined to build a quiz application using javascript where users can answer and recieve instant feedback. It serves educational purposes well and is a great starting point for more complex quiz systems.

**Future Enhancements**
Future improvements may include adding multiple difficulty levels, connecting to a database for storing user feedback and scores, introducing a leaderboard system, and improving accessibility for all users.
